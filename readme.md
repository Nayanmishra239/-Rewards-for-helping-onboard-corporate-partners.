# Rewards for Helping Onboard Corporate Partners

## Project Title
Rewards for Helping Onboard Corporate Partners

## Project Description
This project introduces a blockchain-based rewards system that incentivizes individuals (referrers) to onboard corporate partners. The system is built on a smart contract that ensures transparency, fairness, and automated reward distribution. The contract allows the owner to add referrers, manage onboarding of corporate partners, and handle reward claims securely.

6. **Secure Transactions**:
   - All reward payouts are managed securely using Ethereum's blockchain.
